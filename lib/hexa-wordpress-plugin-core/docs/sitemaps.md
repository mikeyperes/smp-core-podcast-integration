# Sitemap recommendation engine

The `Sitemaps` namespace is opt-in through `SitemapModule` in a host CoreBootstrap.
Multiple hosts register it safely once. No recommendation read writes Rank Math.

## JSON endpoints (Parts 1 and 2)

All REST routes require `manage_options`. Cookie authentication requires `X-WP-Nonce` (wp_rest); WordPress application passwords also work. No public or nopriv handlers.

- GET `/wp-json/hexa-core/v1/sitemaps?site_type=publication`: no body. Returns `{site,site_type,rank_math_active,generated_at,rows:[{id,label,kind,name,url,setting,recommended,recommended_by,current,available,warnings,condition?,counts?,live_check?}]}`. The empty site_type denotes current site. Named types are passed to host recommendation filters, not treated as another site's live settings. Current Rank Math settings and counts always refer to this site.
- POST `/wp-json/hexa-core/v1/sitemaps/check`: `{id}`. Returns `{id,url,result}` with the actual server response. Host filter `hexa_plugin_core_sitemap_check` can reuse an existing checker. Results persist separately.
- POST `/wp-json/hexa-core/v1/sitemaps/change`: `{id,on:boolean}`. Returns `{ok,id,on,message}`. Writes only that registered Rank Math setting/module, then invalidates Rank Math sitemap storage. Never called automatically. Errors return `{ok:false,message}`.
- POST `/wp-json/hexa-core/v1/sitemaps/conditions`: `{id,more_than:2,min_posts:1,apply:false}`. Returns `{ok,condition}`. Whole taxonomy recommendations require more than `more_than` terms. Counts include all existing terms; would_show counts those meeting min_posts. `apply:true` explicitly enables Rank Math sitemap/entry exclusions; defaults never change output. Author counts are published post authors, and min_posts counts published posts.

AJAX equivalents at admin-ajax.php: `hexa_sitemaps_lookup`, `hexa_sitemaps_check`, `hexa_sitemaps_change`, `hexa_sitemaps_conditions`. Require administrator capability and nonce action `hexa_sitemaps` in field `nonce`. AJAX returns WordPress `{success,data}`. Change uses `on=1|0`. Conditions uses `apply=1` or empty, with the same numeric fields.

WP-CLI JSON: `wp hexa sitemaps list [--site-type=publication]`, `check --id=index`, `change --id=post_type_page --on=1`, `conditions --id=taxonomy_category --more-than=2 --min-posts=3 [--apply]`. CLI uses the trusted operating-system/site account as WordPress CLI normally does.

## Host extension contract

Filter `hexa_plugin_core_sitemap_recommendations` receives the complete associative row map and site_type. Hosts change only recommendation fields for registered types, and can add complete rows for additional providers. `recommended_by` is a list of plugin names. `setting` is the exact Rank Math sitemap option; `kind=module` uses name as module slug. Unwritable external providers use an empty setting. Base Tools bridges its documented `hws_base_tools_sitemap_recommendations` filter into this shared filter.

Snapshots: option `hexa_plugin_core_sitemap_recommendations`, keyed by current/named type. Conditions and live checks use separate options. All options are non-autoloaded. Snapshots refresh per lookup, so plugin activation and new content appear immediately without changing Rank Math.

## System exclusions and address collisions

Declared `RecommendationRegistry::EXCLUDED_POST_TYPES` and `SYSTEM_PREFIXES` classify helper content. Providers extend through `hexa_plugin_core_sitemap_excluded_post_types` and `hexa_plugin_core_sitemap_system_post_type_prefixes`. Policy runs after recommendation providers, so helpers remain recommended off. Rows carry `policy_warnings`. A taxonomy sharing a content-type sitemap address gets `collision_with` (winning content row ID), recommended false and a named warning. Change-on requests are refused before any Rank Math write. Disabling remains allowed. Current settings are never changed by lookup.

Exclusion membership does not register a sitemap or inventory private WordPress internals. Inventory remains registered public content plus the explicitly listed media and Elementor types; exclusions also apply to rows supplied by providers.

## Junk sitemaps

Post types in `EXCLUDED_POST_TYPES` (or matching `SYSTEM_PREFIXES`) and taxonomies in `JUNK_TAXONOMIES` (filter `hexa_plugin_core_sitemap_junk_taxonomies`) are junk: never recommended and flagged `junk` in the lookup. `disable_junk` turns every junk sitemap off in Rank Math in one action; `promote` (id, main) moves one row back to the main list (stored in `hexa_plugin_core_sitemap_promoted`) without changing Rank Math. CLI: `wp hexa sitemaps disable-junk`, `wp hexa sitemaps promote --id=<id> --main=1`.

## Plugin-owned sitemaps

Each plugin declares the sitemaps it owns in its `src/Sitemaps/SitemapTypes.php`, calling `SitemapProviders::register($slug, $plugin_name, $settings_url, [['id'=>'post_type_profile','recommended'=>true|callable,'why'=>'...']])` (filter `hexa_plugin_core_sitemap_providers`). Lookup then gives every declared row `owner`, `owner_label`, `owner_url`, the owner's `recommended` and `why`; undeclared rows keep `owner` empty. Providers apply after the host recommendation filter and before the junk and collision policy.

Site-type rules: a declared row with `'site_types'=>['personal_website', ...]` applies only when the lookup's site type is one of them. It sets the recommendation and reason but never takes ownership, so a plugin can give a site-type rule for a row another plugin or Core owns (for example `authors`). Site-type rules run after every owner's rule. A callable recommendation receives `($row, $site_type)`. With no `--site-type`, the lookup uses filter `hexa_plugin_core_site_type`, which the plugin that records the site's type supplies.

`SitemapsPanel::render($slug)` is the plugin's own Sitemaps section: its declared rows only, with recommendation, Rank Math state, a new-tab address and a turn on/off button through the shared `hexa_sitemaps_*` AJAX actions. Other screens (HWS Base Tools) show owned rows read-only and link to `owner_url`.
