# Item Link Behavior And Lightbox

## Namespace And Folder

`Hexa\PluginCore\PublicComponents\ItemLink` and
`Hexa\PluginCore\PublicComponents\ItemLightbox` in `src/PublicComponents/`.

## Purpose

One setting decides what a click on an item link does in every public
component that lists items (`Calendar`, `Map`):

| `link_behavior` | Click result |
| --- | --- |
| `page` (default) | Follows the link in the same tab. |
| `new_tab` | Opens the link in a new tab (`target="_blank" rel="noopener"`). The legacy calendar `link_target => '_blank'` still means this. |
| `lightbox` | Shows the linked post in an in-page dialog, so visitors can click through a calendar or a map without leaving the page. |

In `lightbox` mode only links to a published, non-password post of an allowed
type open in the dialog; every other link (a user, another post type, an
outside URL) keeps following its link. Every lightbox link keeps its real
`href`, so it works without JavaScript, and a Ctrl/Cmd/Shift/Alt or middle
click still opens the page.

## Setup

```php
'link_behavior' => 'lightbox',
'lightbox'      => [
    'post_types' => [ 'event' ],                     // default: the component's post types
    'render'     => fn( int $post_id ): string => '…', // dialog body (escape it); default: image, title, excerpt
    'assets'     => fn() => wp_enqueue_style( '…' ),   // styles the render markup needs
    'page_link'  => true,                             // false hides the dialog's "Open full page" link
    'layout'     => 'default',                        // 'media': large dialog, photo beside the details
],
```

A map card row may name its post with `id`; otherwise Core resolves it from the
row URL (only in lightbox mode, once per cached payload). A calendar `callback`
provider may set `post_id` on an item the same way.

## REST Endpoint

```text
GET /wp-json/hexa-plugin-core/v1/lightbox/{calendar|map}/{profile}/{post_id}
```

Returns `{ html, title, url }` under the profile's visibility (anonymous
responses are publicly cacheable for 60 seconds). It answers 404 unless the
profile uses `lightbox` and the post is eligible. While `render` runs, the post
is the global post, so template tags and post-aware shortcodes read it.

## Dialog

A native modal `<dialog>`: focus moves into it and returns to the clicked
link, Escape, the close button, a backdrop click, and the browser Back button
close it, and the page behind does not scroll. Phones get a bottom sheet.
Responses are cached in the page, so reopening an item is instant. Labels:
`lightbox_close`, `lightbox_open`, `lightbox_loading`, `lightbox_error`,
`lightbox_prev`, `lightbox_next`, `lightbox_count` (`%1$s of %2$s`).

Previous and Next buttons beside the close button (and the left and right
arrow keys) step through the component's other dialog links in page order,
each item once, so a calendar month reads like a slideshow. The buttons are
worded (`lightbox_prev`, `lightbox_next`; a host names its items, for example
"Previous event") with the item's place between them ("4 of 18"). They hide
when the component has one item and grey out at either end.

A step keeps the shown item on screen until the next one is fetched and its
photo decoded, then fades through to it; a phone sheet eases to its new
height. As an item opens, the items either side (and the one two ahead in the
stepping direction) load in the background, so a step is usually instant. Visitors who ask for reduced motion get the swap without fades.

The open item is kept in the address as `?hlb=<post ID>`: opening adds it as
one history entry, each step replaces it, and closing (or Back) removes it. A
page loaded with `?hlb=<post ID>` opens that item when a dialog link to it is
on the page (the calendar keeps its month in the address, so a reload lands on
the same month); otherwise the parameter is dropped. The calendar ignores
`hlb` when it reads its own state.

## Theming

The dialog copies these custom properties from the clicked component, so a page
builder styles it where it styles the calendar or map: `--hlb-bg`, `--hlb-fg`,
`--hlb-muted`, `--hlb-border`, `--hlb-accent`, `--hlb-radius`, `--hlb-width`
(720px), `--hlb-backdrop`.

## Testing

`php tests/item-link.php`.

## Media layout

`'layout' => 'media'` opens a large dialog (`--hlb-media-width`, default
1240px; `--hlb-media-height`, default 880px; both capped to the viewport) with
the photo filling the left and the details scrolling in a right column
(`--hlb-details-width`, default 440px). On screens up to 760px the photo
stacks above the details. Host renders call
`ItemLightbox::media( $attachment_id, $details_html, $alt = '' )`, which prints
the original upload with its responsive `srcset` so the browser loads a sharp
rendition; the default body uses the same layout when no `render` is set.
